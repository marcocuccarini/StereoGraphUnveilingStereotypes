# StereoGraph

**"Unveiling Stereotypes: StereoGraph-Enhanced LLMs for Knowledge-Driven Stereotype Explanation"**  
Presented at **CLIC-it 2025**

StereoGraph is a framework designed to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured knowledge for the detection and explanation of stereotypes. This repository contains all the code, data, and documentation needed to reproduce the experiments from the paper.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Combines LLMs with knowledge graphs for stereotype explanation
- Supports models like **Gemma**, **LLaMA**, and **Mistral** (via [Ollama](https://ollama.ai))
- Human and automated evaluation modules
- Jupyter-compatible pipeline for analysis and experimentation

## ðŸš€ Running the Pipeline

Run the experiment using either of the following:

### Option 1: Python script
```bash
python main.py
```

### Option 2: Jupyter Notebook
Open `main.ipynb` and run all cells.

The system runs experiments using three LLMs: **Gemma**, **LLaMA**, and **Mistral**. It processes a triple-stereotype dataset and can be extended to any model available via **Ollama**.

---

## ðŸ“š Data

- `data/error analysis/`: IDs and human annotations used in error analysis
- `data/test e graph creation/`: Dataset used to create the knowledge graph and for testing
- `human_evaluation/`: Contains the results of human evaluations
